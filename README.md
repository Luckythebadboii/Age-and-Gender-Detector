# Age-and-Gender-Detector
This project is a real-time age and gender detector implemented in Python using the OpenCV library. It utilizes pre-trained deep learning models to accurately predict the age and gender of individuals from images or real-time video streams.

Features:
-Real-time Detection: Detects faces in real-time from a webcam or video stream.
-Age Prediction: Predicts the age of each detected face.
-Gender Prediction: Determines the gender of each detected face.
-Accuracy: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models to achieve high accuracy in age and gender prediction.
-User-friendly Interface: Provides a simple and intuitive user interface for easy interaction.

Technologies Used:-
Python: Programming language used for implementation.
OpenCV: Open Source Computer Vision Library for face detection and image processing.
Deep Learning Models: Pre-trained convolutional neural network models for age and gender prediction.

How it Works:
The system first detects faces in the input image or video stream using the OpenCV face detection module. Once faces are detected, the system extracts facial features and utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to predict the age and gender of each individual. The predictions are then displayed in real-time, providing instant feedback to the user.
